            <p class="title">em, rem and % VS px</p><br><br>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Ems are a relative measure of length. The size of an em is relative to the font-size of its parent element.
                    % are a relative measure of length just like em but only with a different scale of measurement. <br><br>
                    
                    Rems, root ems, are always relative to the font-size of the html element. It doesn’t matter how deeply nested an
                    element is, its rem lengths will always be a proportion of the font-size of html>.
                    px is an absolute unit of measurement in CSS. <br><br>
                    
                    So if we know what ems rems % and px are, In my opinion , it’s preferable if we use relative size like ems, rems and %
                    rather than px. Because it helps the page to be responsive to the changes of screen and also alteration of the size of
                    the browser (not the same as using the zooming feature of the browser). <br><br>
                    But we should be careful not to use relative size on elements like borders and some others. And Thankfully, setting
                    font-sizes in pixels doesn’t completely ruin accessibility. The user can still zoom in and out with ctrl plus +/- (cmd
                    instead of ctrl on OS X). However, we must do better. <br><br>
                    
                    Generally, using relative size depends on the developer and the elements we are sizing.

            <p class="title">Basic changes in CSS3</p><br><br>
            <article>
                <p>CSS3 allows developers to style HTML elements easier. They are less dependent on image files and can complete CSS
                    styling with fewer lines of code. And since CSS3 is backwards-compatible, its like no disadvantage to be
                    considered.</p>
            
            
                <h2>Main New Features</h2>
            
                <h3>Box Shadow</h3>
                <p>One of the CSS3 new features is the box-shadow property that adds a shadow to an element. Instead of using
                    multiple
                    images around an item, this property lets you add shadow with a short line of code.
                    Opacity</p>
                <p>One of the CSS3 properties called opacity makes elements see-through or completely transparent.
                    For instance, you can apply opacity to images or other HTML elements. The transparency level depends on the
                    indicated
                    values.</p>
            
            
                <h3>Rounded Corners</h3>
                <p>Before the release of CSS3, developers had to write long code to produce rounded corners. Now, it is enough to
                    apply the
                    border-radius CSS3 property to HTML elements.</p>
            
                <h3>Attribute Selectors</h3>
                <p>CSS3 also introduced new selectors in addition to the ones in CSS2. Instead of applying IDs or classes for
                    styling,
                    developers can select HTML elements according to their attributes.
                    As a result, you do not have to create unique IDs only to apply CSS rules.
                    New Colors</p>
                <ul>One of the CSS3 features is the addition of new colors:
                    <li>RGBA</li>
                    <li>HSL</li>
                    <li>HSLA</li>
                    <li>Gradient colors</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>More than Web-Safe Fonts</h3>
                <p>Instead of only using fonts labeled as web-safe, developers now can apply more unique fonts in their HTML
                    documents.
                    Before that, CSS wanted to ensure that all browsers and machines display fonts the same.</p>

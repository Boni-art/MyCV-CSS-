                <p> The origins of the Internet date back nearly 40 years, with the U.S. military's funding of a
                    research network dubbed Arpanet in 1969. Since then, the Internet has undergone more than just
                    a name change.</p>
                <p> The number of computers connected to the Internet has grown exponentially, while
                    the number of users has risen from a handful of computer scientists to
                    1.5 billion consumers. The network's reach has expanded beyond the United States to every corner of the globe.
                </p>
                <p> But its
                    popularity has a dark side, as it has evolved from a friendly research network to a hotbed of criminal activity
                    including fraud and identity theft.</p>

                <p>CSS3 allows developers to style HTML elements easier. They are less dependent on image files and can complete CSS
                styling with fewer lines of code. And since CSS3 is backwards-compatible, its like no disadvantage to be considered.</p>
                
                
                <h2>Main New Features</h2>
                
                <h3>Box Shadow</h3>
                <p>One of the CSS3 new features is the box-shadow property that adds a shadow to an element. Instead of using multiple
                images around an item, this property lets you add shadow with a short line of code.
                Opacity</p>
                <p>One of the CSS3 properties called opacity makes elements see-through or completely transparent.
                For instance, you can apply opacity to images or other HTML elements. The transparency level depends on the indicated
                values.</p>
                
                
                <h3>Rounded Corners</h3>
                <p>Before the release of CSS3, developers had to write long code to produce rounded corners. Now, it is enough to apply the
                border-radius CSS3 property to HTML elements.</p>
                
                <h3>Attribute Selectors</h3>
                <p>CSS3 also introduced new selectors in addition to the ones in CSS2. Instead of applying IDs or classes for styling,
                developers can select HTML elements according to their attributes.
                As a result, you do not have to create unique IDs only to apply CSS rules.
                New Colors</p>
                <ul>One of the CSS3 features is the addition of new colors:
                    <li>RGBA</li>
                    <li>HSL</li>
                    <li>HSLA</li>
                    <li>Gradient colors</li>
                </ul> 

                <h3>More than Web-Safe Fonts</h3>
                <p>Instead of only using fonts labeled as web-safe, developers now can apply more unique fonts in their HTML documents.
                Before that, CSS wanted to ensure that all browsers and machines display fonts the same.</p>

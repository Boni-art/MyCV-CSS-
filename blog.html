                <p> The origins of the Internet date back nearly 40 years, with the U.S. military's funding of a
                    research network dubbed Arpanet in 1969. Since then, the Internet has undergone more than just
                    a name change.</p>
                <p> The number of computers connected to the Internet has grown exponentially, while
                    the number of users has risen from a handful of computer scientists to
                    1.5 billion consumers. The network's reach has expanded beyond the United States to every corner of the globe.

                <p> But its
                    popularity has a dark side, as it has evolved from a friendly research network to a hotbed of criminal activity
                    including fraud and identity theft.</p>
